"""
Priority Scoring (v3 formula, matches data_room/product_docs/ticket_dashboard_overview.md).

score = (urgency_weight * 40) + (segment_weight * 30) + (days_open_capped * 30 / 14)

Lessons 15.1 (plan) / 15.2 (implement incrementally): this module is the
starter-repo stub. At Section 13, it exists but is NOT called from
server.py or the UI -- wiring it in is exactly what 15.2 does. If you're
using this file as the "before" state for that lecture, strip the body of
compute_score() back to a TODO and rebuild it on camera.
