"""
BeaconWorks MCP server -- read-only ticket and customer lookup tools.

Used for:
  21.1 Trace an MCP tool invocation (read-only ticket lookup)
  21.2 Distinguish capabilities (tools/resources/prompts)
  21.3 Connect and test a server in Codex
  21.4 Inspect authentication and trust (denied access, untrusted result)
  22.1 Build read-only Python tools
  22.2 Validate and enforce access rules
  22.3 Package a skill and server (ticket-triage plugin, Project 7)
  22.4 Add optional UI and test the workflow (headless-safe)

Deliberately read-only: no tool here can write. Any "reply" or "action"
lesson (9.x, 19.4, 25.4) goes through the approval flow in the ticket
dashboard app, not through this server -- keep that boundary visible on
screen, it's the point of lesson 21.4.

Requires: pip install mcp
